This is a visualizing application made to help coders visualize how an algorithm maps and traverses through a given grid.
The application provides an empty grid structure by default with the starting node and the target node already set.
The application provides three maze types for the algorithms to traverse and map. The maze types are 'No Maze', 'Binary Tree' and 'Recursive Division'. User can select any type of maze at once.
Application currently provides 4 algorithms for visualizing. These are 'A-Star', 'Breadth First Search', 'Depth First Search' & 'Dijkstra'. User can select any one of the given algorithms at once.
This app also lets the user choose the speed at which the algorithm works through a given maze. Three speed types are given which are, 'Fast', 'Medium' and 'Slow'. 'Fast' is selected by default.
The app works in the following way: 1. The application by default has 'No Maze' selected as its Maze type. It has 'Breadth First Search' selected by default. It also has 'Fast' speed selected by default.
                                    2. The user can select any of the three mazes by clicking on the drop down menu given. User can then select any one of the 4 algorithms given in the drop down menu. Finally user can select any ony of the 3 speed types.
                                    3. After selecting required parameters, user can click the play button which then starts the algorithm which the user has selected.
                                    4. When the selected algorithm is working its way, user cannot select any more mazes or algorithms or speed types. He/She has to wait until the algorithm has finished working.
                                    5. After the algorithm has finished working, the play button turns into a reset button which when clicked, resets the mapping of the previous algorithm and clears the maze.
Potential users can clone this repo and edit the application as they see fit. Users can also add new maze types and algorithms.
